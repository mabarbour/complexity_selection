              as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical
              procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a
              more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random
              effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the
              last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for
              practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability
              of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple
              cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical
              inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review

               Deviance for differences associated with four ecological
               characteristics of preadult herbivores: feeding biology,
               invasion status, and the cultivation status and latitudinal zone
               of the habitat. Total enemy-induced mortality is higher in the
               late developmental stages, and overall, parasitoids kill more
               herbivores than do either predators or pathogens. Among the
               ecological variables, both feeding biology and latitude showed
               significant enemy effects in at least one late developmental
               stage, whereas neither cultivation status nor invasion status

               the ecological variables. However, raw probabilities and
               comparisons across herbivore immature stages suggest several
               patterns that deserve attention in future studies: (1)
               endophytic herbivores suffer lower mortality by predators and
               pathogens than exophytics, and endophytic leaf miners suffer the
               greatest parasitoid-induced mortality, while endophytic
               gallers/borers/root feeders suffer the least; (2) overall
               enemy-induced mortality is similar in natural and cultivated
               habitats; (3) exotic insects do not suffer lower enemy-induced
               mortality rates than natives; and (4) predation and disease may
               be greater in tropical/subtropical habitats, whereas parasitism
               is greater in the temperate zone. These results identify several
               general patterns in insect demographics that should be useful

              female insects will evolve to oviposit on hosts on which their
              offspring fare best. In this study, we use meta-analysis to
              assess the balance of evidence for and against the PPH, and to
              evaluate the role of individual factors proposed to influence
              host selection by female insects. We do so in an explicitly
              bitrophic context (herbivores versus plants). Overall, our
              analyses offer clear support for the PPH: Offspring survive
              better on preferred plant types, and females lay more eggs on
              plant types conducive to offspring performance. We also found
              evidence for an effect of diet breadth on host choice: female
              preference for 'good quality plants' was stronger in oligophagous

  abstract = "Most studies of adaptive radiation in animals focus on resource
              competition as the primary driver of trait divergence. The roles
              of other ecological interactions in shaping divergent phenotypes
              during such radiations have received less attention. We evaluate
              natural enemies as primary agents of diversifying selection on
              the phenotypes of an actively diverging lineage of gall midges on
              tall goldenrod. In this system, the gall of the midge consists of
              a biotrophic fungal symbiont that develops on host-plant leaves
              and forms distinctly variable protective carapaces over midge
              larvae. Through field studies, we show that fungal gall
              morphology, which is induced by midges (i.e., it is an extended
              phenotype), is under directional and diversifying selection by
              parasitoid enemies. Overall, natural enemies disruptively select
              for either small or large galls, mainly along the axis of gall
              thickness. These results imply that predators are driving the
              evolution of phenotypic diversity in symbiotic defense traits in
              this system and that divergence in defensive morphology may
              provide ecological opportunities that help to fuel the adaptive
              radiation of this genus of midges on goldenrods. This
              enemy-driven phenotypic divergence in a diversifying lineage

               life history that entails larval development in a gall with
               several sibs, maturation of a single batch of gametes during
               pupal development, and an ephemeral adult existence that
               includes many ovipositional events, each of which results in
               formation of a gall. Ecological factors acting on both the adult
               and larval stages were evaluated to determine the selective
               pressure they exert on the number of eggs deposited per
               ovipositional site (i.e., clutch size). Optimal clutch size is
               determined by a balance between the fitness per offspring, which
               is dependent on clutch size, and the number of clutches mothers
               can deposit in their brief life-span. As clutch size increased,
               so did sibling competition, with the result of smaller size and
               lower fecundity for larvae developing in large clutches. Larval
               survivorship was lower in small clutches because of differential
               attack by parasitoids. From the offspring's viewpoint, benefits
               of small clutch size out-weighed the deficits, since those
               deposited in clutches of one enjoyed the greatest potential
               fitness. A model was constructed indicating that when mothers
               experience no risk of mortality, optimal clutch size from their
               viewpoint is also one. However as the risk of mortality between
               ovipositional events increases, females are unlikely to survive
               to deposit all their eggs. When fewer clutches can be formed,
               females will be selected to deposit several eggs per clutch,
               since this results in the development of many moderately fecund
               offspring whose aggregate fitness is greater than that of the
               few highly fecund offspring that would result if one egg were

               used a common garden experiment to quantify the extent to which
               heritable trait variation in a host plant determines the
               assembly of its associated insect food web (network of trophic

               the additive effects of genetic variation on overall food-web

               20\% over the range of genetic variation in the experimental

              herbivore responses remain poorly explored for most systems. * We
              address this knowledge gap by examining the influence of both
              genetic and phenotypic variation in a dominant host-plant
              species, Salix hookeriana, on its associated arthropod herbivore
              community in a common garden experiment. Specifically, we
              surveyed herbivore responses among five different arthropod
              feeding guilds to 26 distinct S. hookeriana genotypes. Moreover,
              we quantified the heritability of a suite of plant traits that
              determine leaf quality (e.g. phenolic compounds, trichomes,
              specific leaf area, C : N) and whole-plant architecture, to
              identify which traits best accounted for herbivore community
              responses to S. hookeriana genotype. * We found that total

              considerably among S. hookeriana genotypes, with strong and
              independent responses of several species and feeding guilds
              driving these patterns. We also found that leaf phenolic
              chemistry displayed extensive heritable variation, whereas leaf
              physiology and plant architecture tended to be less heritable. Of
              these traits, herbivore responses were primarily associated with
              leaf phenolics and plant architecture; however, different
              herbivore species and feeding guilds were associated with
              different sets of traits. Despite our thorough trait survey,
              plant genotype remained a significant predictor of herbivore
              responses in most trait association analyses, suggesting that
              unmeasured host-plant characteristics and/or interspecific
              interactions were also contributing factors. * Taken together,
              our results support that the genetic basis of herbivore community
              assembly occurs through a suite of plant traits for different
              herbivore species and feeding guilds. Still, identifying these
