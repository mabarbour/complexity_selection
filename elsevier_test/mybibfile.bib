  abstract  = "Oak apples, honeydew and ambrosia galls, witches' brooms, and
               fasciations---all are types of plant galls, a commonly observed,
               yet little-understood botanical phenomenon. Often beautiful and
               bizarre, galls are growths of various shapes, sizes, and colors
               produced by host plants in response to invading organisms. This
               guide, a trove of natural history lore, explores this hidden
               realm, taking a fascinating look at the world of plant galls,
               the organisms that initiate them, their host plants, and their
               intricate behaviors. Focusing on native trees and shrubs, but
               also discussing several galls that occur on herbaceous and
               ornamental plants, it illuminates the complex interrelationship
               between botany and entomology and magnifies our awareness of
               plant communities in the West. * Identifies more than 300
               species of galls---95 on oaks, 22 on members of the rose family,
               60 desert species, and 35 species that are new to science *
               Describes plant galls from coastal dunes, the high Sierra, the
               Great Basin, forests throughout the western states, and the
               Mojave and Sonoran deserts * Includes information on host
               selection, growth and development, predator and parasite
               defense, and animal and human uses of galls",

  abstract  = "The last 15 years has seen parallel surges of interest in two
               research areas that have rarely intersected: biodiversity and
               ecosystem functioning (BEF), and multispecies predator--prey
               interactions (PPI). Research addressing role of biodiversity in
               ecosystem functioning has focused primarily on single
               trophic-level systems, emphasizing additive effects of diversity
               that manifest through resource partitioning and the sampling
               effect. Conversely, research addressing predator--prey
               interactions has focused on two trophic-level systems,
               emphasizing indirect and non-additive interactions among
               species. Here, we use a suite of consumer-resource models to
               organize and synthesize the ways in which consumer species
               diversity affects the densities of both resources and consumer
               species. Specifically, we consider sampling effects, resource
               partitioning, indirect effects caused by intraguild interactions
               and non-additive effects. We show that the relationship between
               consumer diversity and the density of resources and consumer
               species are broadly similar for systems with one vs. two trophic
               levels, and that indirect and non-additive interactions
               generally do little more than modify the impacts of diversity
               established by the sampling effect and resource partitioning.
               The broad similarities between systems with one vs. two trophic
               levels argue for greater communication between researchers
               studying BEF, and researchers studying multispecies PPI.",

              have proved controversial. The qualitative data on which those

              trophic complexity and diversity in 59 quantitative food webs
              from seven studies (14-202 species) based on recently developed
              quantitative descriptors. Our results shed new light on food-web
              structure. First, webs are much simpler when considered
              quantitatively, and link density exhibits scale invariance or
              weak dependence on food-web size. Second, the ``constant
              connectance'' hypothesis is not supported: connectance decreases
              with web size in both qualitative and quantitative data.

              we lack an understanding of how specific ecological changes drive
              this variation. Ecological factors can alter phenotypic selection
              coefficients through changes in trait distributions or individual
              mean fitness, even when the trait-absolute fitness relationship
              remains constant. We apply and extend a regression-based approach
              in a population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) and suggest metrics of
              environment-selection relationships that can be compared across
              studies. We then introduce a novel method which constructs an
              environmentally-structured fitness function. This allows
              calculation of full (as in existing approaches) and partial
              (acting separately through the absolute fitness function slope,
              mean fitness, and phenotype distribution) sensitivities of

              positive overall effects of density on viability selection of

              such mechanisms of environmental dependence of selection are
              common, this could have important implications regarding the
              frequency of fluctuating selection, and how previous selection

              mutualisms have been examined by comparing the fraction of
              possible pairwise interactions established in a series of
              plant-pollinator and plant-seed disperser systems. As the number
              of species in the mutualistic system increases, the absolute
              number of interactions established increases, but connectance
              decreases exponentially. A given increase in diversity adds twice
              the number of interactions to dispersal systems as to pollination
              systems, suggesting a higher global specificity of the latter.
              Connectance patterns in mutualisms are analogous to some of those
              observed in complex food webs, suggesting a somewhat invariant
              structure in the relations between sets of interacting species.
              For seed-dispersal systems involving frugivorous birds, mutual
              dependence values are strongly skewed toward the low end and
              illustrate generally strong asymmetries in mutualistic
              interactions. These patterns may be expected by considering
              simple multiplicative effects within multispecies assemblages as
              a result of variations in the number of species and in the
              underlying abundance distributions of the species involved.
              Coadaptation may originate from a process of species sorting
              without the necessity of genetic (coevolved) changes.
              Asymmetrical interactions and the prevalence of weak relations
              can provide pathways for rare species to persist and alternative
              routes for system responses to perturbations. These findings

               dynamics and stability of both populations and traits, as well
               as theory predicting how predatory and anti-predator traits
               should respond to environmental changes. Evolution can stabilize
               or destabilize interactions; stability is most likely when only
               the predator evolves, or when traits in one or both species are
               under strong stabilizing selection. Stability seems least likely
               when there is coevolution and a bi-directional axis of prey
               vulnerability. When population cycles exist, adaptation may
               either increase or decrease the amplitude of those cycles. An
               increase in the defensive ability of prey is less likely to
               produce evolutionary counter-measures in its partner than is a
               comparable increase in attack ability of the predator. Increased
               productivity may increase or decrease offensive and defensive
               adaptations. The apparent predominance of evolutionary responses
               of prey to predators over those of predators to prey is in
               general accord with equilibrium theory, but theory on stability
               may be difficult to confirm or refute. Recent work on

  abstract = "abstract: I give an overview of the observational and
              experimental evidence for ecological character displacement in
              adaptive radiation. Sixty‐one published cases of character
              displacement involving closely related species (congeners) make
              up the observational data set. All cases involve divergence, even
              though parallel and convergent displacement are theoretically
              possible. Character ratios in sympatry were greatest when
              displacement was symmetric (mean 1.54) and least when asymmetric
              (mean 1.29), perhaps because the most symmetric resource
              distributions are also the broadest. Carnivores are vastly
              overrepresented in the data compared with other trophic groups,
              with herbivores the next most common category. I consider five
              hypotheses to explain this pattern, including the possibility
              that the likelihood of divergence via competition depends on
              position in food webs. Overall, the quality and completeness of
              observational data has improved in recent years, as judged by the
              extent to which individual cases satisfy six standard criteria.
              All but one of the criteria are met in over half the cases. Most
              often lacking is independent evidence that the species involved
              compete for resources. For this reason, we cannot be sure that
              divergence in sympatry is usually the result of resource
              competition rather than some other interaction. Field experiments
              on character displacement, which explore how interaction strength
              changes per unit change in phenotypic traits, are only just
              beginning. I summarize research on threespine sticklebacks that
              used experiments in ponds to test three predictions: that
              present‐day differences between sympatric species are a ``ghost''
              of competition past; that adding a competitor alters natural
              selection pressures on a species already present, favoring
              divergence; and that divergent natural selection stemming from
              resource competition is frequency dependent. In total, the
              evidence suggests that character displacement occurs frequently
              in nature, and it probably plays an important role in the
              evolution of diversity in many adaptive radiations.",

               significant enemy effects in at least one late developmental
               stage, whereas neither cultivation status nor invasion status
               was associated with enemy-induced mortality in any stage.
               Bonferroni adjustment of probabilities for multiple comparisons
               resulted in few significant interactions between enemy type and
               the ecological variables. However, raw probabilities and
               comparisons across herbivore immature stages suggest several
               patterns that deserve attention in future studies: (1)
               endophytic herbivores suffer lower mortality by predators and
               pathogens than exophytics, and endophytic leaf miners suffer the
               greatest parasitoid-induced mortality, while endophytic
               gallers/borers/root feeders suffer the least; (2) overall
               enemy-induced mortality is similar in natural and cultivated
               habitats; (3) exotic insects do not suffer lower enemy-induced
               mortality rates than natives; and (4) predation and disease may
               be greater in tropical/subtropical habitats, whereas parasitism
               is greater in the temperate zone. These results identify several
               general patterns in insect demographics that should be useful
               for hypothesis testing.",

               of searching for additional hosts until they have fed on the
               individual chosen by their mother (but see Wint, 1983; Futuyma

               the events and factors influencing oviposition. Ecologists and

               involved by using shorthand terms to represent abstract concepts

               determining the immediate outcome of a particular encounter
               between insect and plant, whereas larval performance, host
               suitability, and plant response to attack describe the

              female insects will evolve to oviposit on hosts on which their

              assess the balance of evidence for and against the PPH, and to
              evaluate the role of individual factors proposed to influence
              host selection by female insects. We do so in an explicitly
              bitrophic context (herbivores versus plants). Overall, our
              analyses offer clear support for the PPH: Offspring survive
              better on preferred plant types, and females lay more eggs on
              plant types conducive to offspring performance. We also found
              evidence for an effect of diet breadth on host choice: female

              competition as the primary driver of trait divergence. The roles
              of other ecological interactions in shaping divergent phenotypes
              during such radiations have received less attention. We evaluate
              natural enemies as primary agents of diversifying selection on
              the phenotypes of an actively diverging lineage of gall midges on
              tall goldenrod. In this system, the gall of the midge consists of
              a biotrophic fungal symbiont that develops on host-plant leaves
              and forms distinctly variable protective carapaces over midge
              larvae. Through field studies, we show that fungal gall
              morphology, which is induced by midges (i.e., it is an extended
              phenotype), is under directional and diversifying selection by
              parasitoid enemies. Overall, natural enemies disruptively select
              for either small or large galls, mainly along the axis of gall
              thickness. These results imply that predators are driving the
              evolution of phenotypic diversity in symbiotic defense traits in
              this system and that divergence in defensive morphology may
              provide ecological opportunities that help to fuel the adaptive
              radiation of this genus of midges on goldenrods. This
              enemy-driven phenotypic divergence in a diversifying lineage

               life history that entails larval development in a gall with
               several sibs, maturation of a single batch of gametes during
               pupal development, and an ephemeral adult existence that
               includes many ovipositional events, each of which results in
               formation of a gall. Ecological factors acting on both the adult
               and larval stages were evaluated to determine the selective
               pressure they exert on the number of eggs deposited per
               ovipositional site (i.e., clutch size). Optimal clutch size is
               determined by a balance between the fitness per offspring, which
               is dependent on clutch size, and the number of clutches mothers
               can deposit in their brief life-span. As clutch size increased,
               so did sibling competition, with the result of smaller size and
               lower fecundity for larvae developing in large clutches. Larval
               survivorship was lower in small clutches because of differential
               attack by parasitoids. From the offspring's viewpoint, benefits
               of small clutch size out-weighed the deficits, since those
               deposited in clutches of one enjoyed the greatest potential
               fitness. A model was constructed indicating that when mothers
               experience no risk of mortality, optimal clutch size from their
               viewpoint is also one. However as the risk of mortality between
               ovipositional events increases, females are unlikely to survive
               to deposit all their eggs. When fewer clutches can be formed,
               females will be selected to deposit several eggs per clutch,
               since this results in the development of many moderately fecund
               offspring whose aggregate fitness is greater than that of the
               few highly fecund offspring that would result if one egg were
               deposited per site.",

               will affect network structure. To address this knowledge gap, we
               used a common garden experiment to quantify the extent to which
               heritable trait variation in a host plant determines the
               assembly of its associated insect food web (network of trophic
               interactions). We then used a resampling procedure to simulate
               the additive effects of genetic variation on overall food-web
               complexity. We found that trait variation among host-plant

              herbivore responses remain poorly explored for most systems. * We
              address this knowledge gap by examining the influence of both
              genetic and phenotypic variation in a dominant host-plant
              species, Salix hookeriana, on its associated arthropod herbivore
              community in a common garden experiment. Specifically, we
              surveyed herbivore responses among five different arthropod
              feeding guilds to 26 distinct S. hookeriana genotypes. Moreover,
              we quantified the heritability of a suite of plant traits that
              determine leaf quality (e.g. phenolic compounds, trichomes,
              specific leaf area, C : N) and whole-plant architecture, to
              identify which traits best accounted for herbivore community
              responses to S. hookeriana genotype. * We found that total
              herbivore abundance and community composition differed
              considerably among S. hookeriana genotypes, with strong and
              independent responses of several species and feeding guilds
              driving these patterns. We also found that leaf phenolic
              chemistry displayed extensive heritable variation, whereas leaf
              physiology and plant architecture tended to be less heritable. Of
              these traits, herbivore responses were primarily associated with
              leaf phenolics and plant architecture; however, different
              herbivore species and feeding guilds were associated with
              different sets of traits. Despite our thorough trait survey,
              plant genotype remained a significant predictor of herbivore
              responses in most trait association analyses, suggesting that
              unmeasured host-plant characteristics and/or interspecific
              interactions were also contributing factors. * Taken together,
              our results support that the genetic basis of herbivore community
              assembly occurs through a suite of plant traits for different
              herbivore species and feeding guilds. Still, identifying these
              phenotypic mechanisms requires measuring a broad range of plant
