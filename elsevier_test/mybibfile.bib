  abstract  = "Theory predicts that intraspecific genetic variation can
               increase the complexity of an ecological network. To date,
               however, we are lacking empirical knowledge of the extent to
               which genetic variation determines the assembly of ecological
               networks, as well as how the gain or loss of genetic variation
               will affect network structure. To address this knowledge gap, we
               used a common garden experiment to quantify the extent to which
               heritable trait variation in a host plant determines the
               assembly of its associated insect food web (network of trophic
               interactions). We then used a resampling procedure to simulate
               the additive effects of genetic variation on overall food-web
               complexity. We found that trait variation among host-plant
               genotypes was associated with resistance to insect herbivores,
               which indirectly affected interactions between herbivores and
               their insect parasitoids. Direct and indirect genetic effects
               resulted in distinct compositions of trophic interactions
               associated with each host-plant genotype. Moreover, our
               simulations suggest that food-web complexity would increase by
               20\% over the range of genetic variation in the experimental
               population of host plants. Taken together, our results indicate
               that intraspecific genetic variation can play a key role in
               structuring ecological networks, which may in turn affect
               network persistence.",

              community assembly",

  abstract = "* Community genetics research has posited a genetic basis to the
              assembly of ecological communities. For arthropod herbivores in
              particular, there is strong support that genetic variation in
              host plants is a key factor shaping their diversity and
              composition. However, the specific plant phenotypes underlying
              herbivore responses remain poorly explored for most systems. * We
              address this knowledge gap by examining the influence of both
              genetic and phenotypic variation in a dominant host-plant
              species, Salix hookeriana, on its associated arthropod herbivore
              community in a common garden experiment. Specifically, we
              surveyed herbivore responses among five different arthropod
              feeding guilds to 26 distinct S. hookeriana genotypes. Moreover,
              we quantified the heritability of a suite of plant traits that
              determine leaf quality (e.g. phenolic compounds, trichomes,
              specific leaf area, C : N) and whole-plant architecture, to
              identify which traits best accounted for herbivore community
              responses to S. hookeriana genotype. * We found that total
              herbivore abundance and community composition differed
              considerably among S. hookeriana genotypes, with strong and
              independent responses of several species and feeding guilds
              driving these patterns. We also found that leaf phenolic
              chemistry displayed extensive heritable variation, whereas leaf
              physiology and plant architecture tended to be less heritable. Of
              these traits, herbivore responses were primarily associated with
              leaf phenolics and plant architecture; however, different
              herbivore species and feeding guilds were associated with
              different sets of traits. Despite our thorough trait survey,
              plant genotype remained a significant predictor of herbivore
              responses in most trait association analyses, suggesting that
              unmeasured host-plant characteristics and/or interspecific
              interactions were also contributing factors. * Taken together,
              our results support that the genetic basis of herbivore community
              assembly occurs through a suite of plant traits for different
              herbivore species and feeding guilds. Still, identifying these
              phenotypic mechanisms requires measuring a broad range of plant
              traits and likely further consideration of how these traits
              affect interspecific interactions.",
